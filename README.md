# L-715-Final-Project


For the final project, I decided to use the data from the EXIST 2023 Shared Task about sexism detection. I used the Spanish data.

Here is an overview of the code:
1. Import the libraries and the data
2. Define functions to create a term-frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix
3. Define the functions related to the neural network
4. Train the neural network on the tf-idf matrix
5. Plot the loss
